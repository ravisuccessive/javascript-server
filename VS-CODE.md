Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.
First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.

FEATURES

1.
-> Emmet Abbreviations
These useful shortcuts come built-in to VS Code, and they make writing HTML (and CSS) a lot faster.

2.
->The Integrated CLI (Command Line Interface)
To save switching between windows, VS Code offers an integrated terminal or CLI. Simply, press CNTRL + ' or CMD + ' to open it up, and the same command to close it. It will automatically open in the directory you have open in VS Code, which saves the navigation step required for operations in a standard terminal.
This makes it easy to install NPM or Yarn dependencies, commit files to Git, and push files to Github — as well as anything else you might want to do via the command line!

3.
-> ESLint
ESLint is a powerful and popular linting tool, which helps you spot errors in your code and fix them as you write and which helps you follow common best-practices. It’s also a great learning tool, since researching ESLint errors has taught me many best practices I didn’t know before, and it’s helped me understand why they are best practices.

4.
->Prettier
Prettier is an opinionated code-formatter. It prescribes a certain formatting style as the correct one, but its popularity is making its rules something of an established standard for JavaScript, CSS, and increasing numbers of other languages.
There is overlap between Prettier and ESLint, but ultimately ESLint is more focused on spotting errors and Prettier is more focused on correcting formatting. They work great together, and there’s an integration to help make this as smooth as possible.

5.
->Multi-Cursor Shortcuts
The ability to edit with multiple cursors can be a huge time saver. To use this most effectively requires memorisation of a handful of commands, but they’ll soon become second nature.
The Basics
To manually add new cursors, hold Alt or Option and then click wherever you want a new cursor. You can go back to a single cursor by pressing Escape . With those two commands, you can save a lot of time. But there’s more!
Column Selection
By holding down Shift + Alt or Shift + Option while you drag your mouse, a new cursor will be added to the end of each selected line.


PLUGINS

1-> Settings Sync
Synchronize settings, snippets, themes, file icons, launch, keybindings, workspaces, and extensions across multiple machines using GitHub gists.

2-> Import Cost
This extension will display inline in the editor the size of the imported package. The extension utilizes webpack with Babili Webpack Plugin in order to detect the imported size.

3-> File Utils 
A convenient way of creating, duplicating, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories.

4-> npm Intellisense
VS Code plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements.

5-> Project Manager
Project Manager helps you to easily access your projects, no matter where they’re located. Don’t miss important projects anymore.
You can define your own projects (also called favorites) or choose autodetect Git, Mercurial or SVN repositories, or VS Code folders (or any other folder).

6-> SVG Viewer
SVG Viewer for VS Code.

7-> Git History
View your Git log and file history. You’re also able to compare branches or commits.

8-> Live Share
Visual Studio Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time, regardless of what programming languages you’re using or app types you’re building.
