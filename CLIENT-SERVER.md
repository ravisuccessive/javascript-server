# What is client-server ??
    
    A client-server network is the medium through which clients access resources and services from a central computer, via either a local area network (LAN) or a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet. ... A major advantage of the client-server network is the central management of applications and data.

### Diffrence between client-server

    Thick Client: a client that provides rich functionality, performs the majority of data processing itself, and relies very lightly upon the server.
    Thin Client: a thin-client server is a lightweight computer that relies heavily on the resources of the host computer -- an application server performs the majority of any required data processing.
    Hybrid Client: possessing a combination of thin client and thick client characteristics, a hybrid client relies on the server to store persistent data, but is capable of local processing.

    Application Server: hosts web applications that users in the network can use without needing their own copy.
    Computing Server: shares an enormous amount of computer resources with networked computers that require more CPU power and RAM than is typically available for a personal computer.
    Database Server: maintains and shares databases for any computer program that ingests well-organized data, such as accounting software and spreadsheets.‍
    Web Server: hosts web pages and facilitates the existence of the World Wide Web.
